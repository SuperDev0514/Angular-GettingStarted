# Angular2-Getting Started
Materials for the "Angular 2: Getting Started" course on Pluralsight.

`APM - Start`: The starter files set up for use in VSCode, WebStorm, or other editors. Use this to code along with the course. (Updated to <i>Beta 15</i>)

`APM - Start VS 2015 ASP 4x`: The starter files set up for Visual Studio 2015 using an ASP.NET 4.x project. (Updated to <i>Beta 15</i>)

`APM - Final`: The completed files. Use this to see the completed solution from the course. (Updated to <i>Beta 15</i>)

`APM - Final Updated`: The completed files UPDATED to a newer version of Angular. These are separate from the files above because as of <i>Beta 16</i> there are <i>breaking changes</i> that cause the files to mismatch with the demos presented in the course.

See the `README.md` file under each folder for details on installing and running the application.

<b>NOTE: We are currently discussing the appropriate time to update the course to the current Angular version.</b>

NOTE: The installation was tested using node v5.0.0 and npm 3.8.6.
