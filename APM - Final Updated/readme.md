This is an updated version of the finished sample code from my Pluralsight course: Angular 2: Getting Started located here: https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angular-2-getting-started.

To use this code:

1) Open a command prompt in the project's root directory (APM)

2) Type: `npm install`
    This installs the dependencies as defined in the package.json file.
    
3) Type: `npm start`
    This launches the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile the application and wait for changes. 
    It also starts the lite-server and launches the browser to run the application.
